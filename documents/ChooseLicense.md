# How to Choose the Proper License

The licensing depends on what kind of application you are developing (desktop-based, web-based or native app).

### FOR DESKTOP APPLICATION

"DESKTOP APPLICATION" means a self-contained application that runs from a local drive and does not require network connectivity to operate.

You will need to purchase:

- PER DEVELOPER LICENSE: enables one named user to develop a single application that uses Dynamsoft Barcode Reader SDK.
- RUNTIME License: each distribution of the application using our Barcode Reader SDK requires a runtime license.

**Note:**

- It is applicable to Windows Edition, Mac Edition and Linux Edition.
- The PER DEVELOPER LICENSE is perpetual but it is limited to one developer. 
- The pricing depends on how many developers will be working on the barcode reading module and how many client machines you have.

### FOR WEB APPLICATION

"WEB APPLICATION" means an Application that is deployed to a Server and has multiple users accessing it remotely.

You will need to purchase:

- YEARLY SERVER LICENSE: a Deployment License which is required to deploy one Application to each production server, development servers, testing servers, and staging servers. 

**Note:**

- It is applicable to Windows Edition and Linux Edition.
- The YEARLY SERVER LICENSE is valid for one year. After the first year, you will need to renew your license in order for your application continue working.
- Currently there is no limit as to how many desktop clients can access the software once it's deployed to the production server.
- The pricing depends on how many web servers you would like to host it on.

### FOR MOBILE APPLICATION

You will need to purchase:

- DEVELOPER LICENSE: is on a per-Application per-named programmer basis.
- RUNTIME License: each distribution of the application using our Barcode Reader SDK requires a runtime license.

**Note:**

- It is limited to one developed App.
- It covers both Android and iOS Apps.
- The pricing depends on how many developers will work on the barcode reading module and how many client machines you have.
