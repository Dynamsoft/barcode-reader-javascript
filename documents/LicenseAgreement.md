The same provision applies if, for example, the developers will not be working with the SOFTWARE at the same time.

**Non-transferable**: a PER-Developer license can be transferred to another developer of the same organization, only if the licensee is no longer working for the organization.

### RUNTIME LICENSE

For each Runtime License of the SOFTWARE purchased by Licensee, Dynamsoft grants Licensee a non-exclusive, non-transferable, perpetual, worldwide license for one (1) named end user to install Application on one personal computer or workstation.

If such named end user installs the Application on an additional computer or workstation, one extra Runtime License is required.
