## Hello World - Simplest Implementation

Let's start with the "Hello World" example of the DBR-JS SDK which demonstrates how to use the minimum code to enable a web page to read barcodes from a live video stream.  

- Basic Requirements
  - Internet connection
  - [A supported browser](#system-requirements)
  - Camera access

### Understand the code

The complete code of the "Hello World" example is shown below

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>

#### About the code

- The DBR-JS SDK is included in the code via the **jsDelivr** CDN.

> In some rare cases, you might not be able to access the CDN. If this happens, you can use [https://download2.dynamsoft.com/dbr/dynamsoft-barcode-reader-js/dynamsoft-barcode-reader-js-9.6.0/dist/dbr.js](https://download2.dynamsoft.com/dbr/dynamsoft-barcode-reader-js/dynamsoft-barcode-reader-js-9.6.0/dist/dbr.js) for the test. However, please remember this link is temporary and DO NOT use it in your production application. Instead, you can try [hosting the SDK yourself](#host-the-sdk-yourself).

- `license`: This property specifies a license key. Note that the license "DLS2eyJvcmdhbml6YXRpb25JRCI6IjIwMDAwMSJ9" used in this example is an online license and requires network connection to work. Read more on [Specify the license](#specify-the-license).

- `createInstance()`: This method creates a `BarcodeScanner` object. This object can read barcodes directly from a video input with the help of its interactive UI (hidden by default) and the <a target="_blank" href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/MediaDevices" title="MediaDevices interface">MediaDevices interface</a>.

- `onFrameRead`: This event is triggered every time the SDK finishes scanning a video frame. The `results` object contains all the barcode results that the SDK have found on this frame. In this example, we print the results to the browser console.

- `onUniqueRead`: This event is triggered when the SDK finds a new barcode, which is not a duplicate among multiple frames. `txt` holds the barcode text value while `result` is an object that holds details of the barcode. In this example, an alert will be displayed for this new barcode.

- `show()`: This method brings up the built-in UI of the `BarcodeScanner` object and starts scanning.

### Run the example

You can run the example deployed to <a target="_blank" href="https://demo.dynamsoft.com/Samples/DBR/JS/1.hello-world/1.hello-world.html?ver=9.6.0&utm_source=github" title="Run in Dynamsoft">the Dynamsoft Demo Server</a> or test it with <a target="_blank" href="https://jsfiddle.net/DynamsoftTeam/pL4e7yrd/" title="Run in JSFiddle">JSFiddle code editor</a>. You will be asked to allow access to your camera, after which the video will be displayed on the page. After that, you can point the camera at a barcode to read it.

When a barcode is decoded, you will see the result text pop up and the barcode location will be highlighted in the video feed.

Alternatively, you can make a local test simply by taking the code in step 1, pasting it in a file with the name "hello-world.html" and open it in a browser.

*Note*:

If you open the web page as `file:///` or `http://` , the camera may not work correctly because the API <a target="_blank" href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/MediaDevices/getUserMedia" title="getUserMedia">getUserMedia</a> usually requires HTTPS to access the camera.

To make sure your web application can access the camera, please configure your web server to support HTTPS. The following links may help.

1. NGINX: <a target="_blank" href="https://nginx.org/en/docs/http/configuring_https_servers.html" title="Configuring HTTPS servers">Configuring HTTPS servers</a>

## Building your own page

### Include the SDK

#### Use a public CDN

The simplest way to include the SDK is to use either the [jsDelivr](https://jsdelivr.com/) or [UNPKG](https://unpkg.com/) CDN. The "hello world" example above uses **jsDelivr**.

- jsDelivr

  ```html
  <script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/dynamsoft-javascript-barcode@9.6.0/dist/dbr.js"></script>
  ```

- UNPKG  

  ```html
  <script src="https://unpkg.com/dynamsoft-javascript-barcode@9.6.0/dist/dbr.js"></script>
  ```

#### Host the SDK yourself

Besides using the public CDN, you can also download the SDK and host its files on your own server or a commercial CDN before including it in your application.

Options to download the SDK:

- From the website

  <a target="_blank" href="https://www.dynamsoft.com/barcode-reader/downloads/?ver=9.6.0&utm_source=github" title="Download the JavaScript Package">Download the JavaScript Package</a>

- yarn

  ```cmd
  yarn add dynamsoft-javascript-barcode
  ```

- npm

  ```cmd
  npm install dynamsoft-javascript-barcode --save
  ```

Depending on how you downloaded the SDK and how you intend to use it, you can typically include it like this:

```html
<script src="/dynamsoft-barcode-reader-js-9.6.0/dist/dbr.js"></script>
```

or

```html
<script src="/node_modules/dynamsoft-javascript-barcode/dist/dbr.js"></script>
```

or

```ts
import { BarcodeScanner } from 'dynamsoft-javascript-barcode';
```

**NOTE**

To work properly, the SDK requires a few engine files, which are relatively large and may take quite a few seconds to download. We recommend that you set a longer cache time to maximize the performance of your web application.

```cmd
Cache-Control: max-age=31536000
```

Reference: [Cache-Control](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Cache-Control).

### Configure the SDK

Before using the SDK, you need to configure a few things.

#### Specify the license

The SDK requires a license to work, use the API `license` to specify a license key.

```javascript
Dynamsoft.DBR.BarcodeScanner.license = "YOUR-LICENSE-KEY";
```

To test the SDK, you can request a 30-day trial license via the [customer portal](https://www.dynamsoft.com/customer/license/trialLicense?ver=9.6.0&utm_source=github&product=dbr&package=js).

> If you register a Dynamsoft account and download the SDK from the official website, Dynamsoft will automatically generate a 30-day trial license for you, and put the license key into all the samples attached to the SDK.

#### Specify the location of the "engine" files

This is usually only required with frameworks like Angular or React, etc. where dbr.js is compiled into another file.

The purpose is to tell the SDK where to find the engine files (\*.worker.js, \*.wasm.js and \*.wasm, etc.). The API is called `engineResourcePath`:

```javascript
//The following code uses the jsDelivr CDN, feel free to change it to your own location of these files
Dynamsoft.DBR.BarcodeScanner.engineResourcePath = "https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/dynamsoft-javascript-barcode@9.6.0/dist/";
```

### Interact with the SDK

#### Create a `BarcodeScanner` object

You can use one of two classes ( `BarcodeScanner` and `BarcodeReader` ) to interact with the SDK. `BarcodeReader` is a low-level class that processes images directly. `BarcodeScanner` , on the other hand, inherits from `BarcodeReader` and provides high-level APIs and a built-in GUI to allow continuous barcode scanning on video frames. We'll focus on `BarcodeScanner` in this guide.

To use the SDK, we first create a `BarcodeScanner` object.

```javascript
Dynamsoft.DBR.BarcodeScanner.license = "YOUR-LICENSE-KEY";
let scanner = null;
try {
    scanner = await Dynamsoft.DBR.BarcodeScanner.createInstance();
} catch (ex) {
    console.error(ex);
}
```

Tip: When creating a `BarcodeScanner` object within a function which may be called more than once, it's best to use a "helper" variable to avoid double creation such as `pScanner` in the following code

```javascript
Dynamsoft.DBR.BarcodeScanner.license = "YOUR-LICENSE-KEY";
let pScanner = null;
document.getElementById('btn-scan').addEventListener('click', async () => {
    try {
        const scanner = await (pScanner = pScanner || Dynamsoft.DBR.BarcodeScanner.createInstance());
    } catch (ex) {
        console.error(ex);
    }
});
```

#### Customize the `BarcodeScanner` Settings (optional)

Let's take a look at the following code snippets:

```javascript
// Sets which camera and what resolution to use
let allCameras = await scanner.getAllCameras();
await scanner.setCurrentCamera(allCameras[0].deviceId);
await scanner.setResolution(1280, 720);
```

```javascript
// Sets up the scanner behavior
let scanSettings = await scanner.getScanSettings();
// Disregards duplicated results found in a specified time period (in milliseconds).
scanSettings.duplicateForgetTime = 5000; // The default is 3000
// Sets a scan interval in milliseconds so the SDK may release the CPU from time to time.
// (setting this value larger is a simple way to save battery power and reduce device heating).
scanSettings.intervalTime = 100; // The default is 0.
// Sets captureAndDecodeInParallel to false, which tells the SDK not to acquire the next frame while decoding the first.
// This is another way to save battery power and is recommended on low-end phones. However, it does slow down the decoding speed.
scanSettings.captureAndDecodeInParallel = false; // The default is true.
await scanner.updateScanSettings(scanSettings);
```

```javascript
// Uses one of the built-in RuntimeSetting templates: "single" (decode a single barcode, the default mode), "speed", "balance", "coverage", "dense" and "distance"
await scanner.updateRuntimeSettings("speed");

// Makes changes to the template. The code below demonstrates how to specify enabled symbologies
let runtimeSettings = await scanner.getRuntimeSettings();
runtimeSettings.barcodeFormatIds = Dynamsoft.DBR.EnumBarcodeFormat.BF_ONED | Dynamsoft.DBR.EnumBarcodeFormat.BF_QR_CODE;
await scanner.updateRuntimeSettings(runtimeSettings);
```

[Try in JSFiddle](https://jsfiddle.net/DynamsoftTeam/yfkcajxz/)

As you can see from the above code snippets, there are three types of configurations:

- Customize the data source: This configuration includes which camera to use, the preferred resolution, etc. Learn more <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/MediaDevices/getUserMedia#Syntax" target="_blank" title="here">here</a>.

- `get/updateScanSettings`: Configures the behavior of the scanner which includes `duplicateForgetTime` and `intervalTime`, etc.

- `get/updateRuntimeSettings`: Configures the decode engine with either a built-in template or a comprehensive `RuntimeSettings` object. For example, the following uses the built-in "speed" settings with updated `localizationModes`.

  ```javascript
  await barcodeScanner.updateRuntimeSettings("speed");
  //await barcodeScanner.updateRuntimeSettings("balance"); //alternative
  //await barcodeScanner.updateRuntimeSettings("coverage"); //alternative
  let settings = await barcodeScanner.getRuntimeSettings();
  settings.localizationModes = [
      Dynamsoft.DBR.EnumLocalizationMode.LM_CONNECTED_BLOCKS,
      Dynamsoft.DBR.EnumLocalizationMode.LM_SCAN_DIRECTLY,
      Dynamsoft.DBR.EnumLocalizationMode.LM_LINES, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0
  ];
  await barcodeScanner.updateRuntimeSettings(settings);
  ```

### Customize the UI (optional)

The built-in UI of the `BarcodeScanner` object is defined in the file `dist/dbr.ui.html` . There are a few ways to customize it:

- Modify the file `dist/dbr.ui.html` directly.

  This option is only possible when you host this file on your own web server instead of using a CDN.

- Copy the file `dist/dbr.ui.html` to your application, modify it and use the the API `defaultUIElementURL` to set it as the default UI.

  ```javascript
  // This line only takes effect before the method `createInstance()` is called.
  Dynamsoft.DBR.BarcodeScanner.defaultUIElementURL = "THE-URL-TO-THE-FILE";
  ```

- Append the default UI element to your page, customize it before showing it.

  ```html
  <div id="div-ui-container"></div>
  ```

  ```javascript
  document.getElementById('div-ui-container').appendChild(scanner.getUIElement());
  document.getElementsByClassName('dce-btn-close')[0].hidden = true; // Hide the close button
  ```

- Build the UI element from scratch and connect it to the SDK with the API `setUIElement(HTMLElement)`.

  - Embed the video

    ```html
    <div id="div-ui-container" style="width:100%;height:100%;">
        <div class="dce-video-container" style="position:relative;width:100%;height:500px;"></div>
    </div>
    <script>
        (async () => {
            let scanner = await Dynamsoft.DBR.BarcodeScanner.createInstance();
            await scanner.setUIElement(document.getElementById('div-ui-container'));
            scanner.onFrameRead = results => {
                console.log(results);
            };
            scanner.onUniqueRead = (txt, result) => {
                alert(txt);
            };
            await scanner.show();
        })();
    </script>
    ```

    > The video element will be created and appended to the DIV element with the class `dce-video-container` , make sure the class name is the same. Besides, the CSS property `position` of the DIV element must be either `relative` , `absolute` , `fixed` , or `sticky` .

    [Try in JSFiddle](https://jsfiddle.net/DynamsoftTeam/2jzeq1r6/)

  - [Optional] Add the camera list and resolution list

    If the class names of these lists match the default class names, i.e. `dce-sel-camera` and `dce-sel-resolution` , the SDK will automatically populate the lists and handle the camera/resolution switching.

    ```html
    <div id="div-ui-container" style="width:100%;height:100%;">
        <select class="dce-sel-camera"></select><br>
        <div class="dce-video-container" style="position:relative;width:100%;height:500px;"></div>
    </div>
    ```

    [Try in JSFiddle](https://jsfiddle.net/DynamsoftTeam/nbj75vxu/)

    ```html
    <div id="div-ui-container">
        <select class="dce-sel-camera"></select>
        <select class="dce-sel-resolution"></select>
        <br>
        <div class="dce-video-container" style="position:relative;width:100%;height:500px;"></div>
    </div>
    ```

    [Try in JSFiddle](https://jsfiddle.net/DynamsoftTeam/25v08paf/)

    > By default, only 3 hard-coded resolutions (1920 x 1080, 1280 x 720，640 x 480) are populated as options. You can show a customized set of options by hardcoding them.

    ```html
    <select class="dce-sel-resolution">
        <option class="dce-opt-gotResolution" value="got"></option>
        <option data-width="1280" data-height="720">1280x720</option>
        <option data-width="1920" data-height="1080">1920x1080</option>
    </select>
    ```

    [Try in JSFiddle](https://jsfiddle.net/DynamsoftTeam/tnfjks4q/)

    > Generally, you need to provide a resolution that the camera supports. However, in case a camera does not support the specified resolution, it usually uses the cloest supported resolution. As a result, the selected resolution may not be the actual resolution. In this case, add an option with the class name `dce-opt-gotResolution` (as shown above) and the SDK will automatically use it to show the **actual resolution**.

## API Documentation

You can check out the detailed documentation about the APIs of the SDK at
[https://www.dynamsoft.com/barcode-reader/docs/web/programming/javascript/api-reference/?ver=9.6.0](https://www.dynamsoft.com/barcode-reader/docs/web/programming/javascript/api-reference/?ver=9.6.0).

## System Requirements

DBR requires the following features to work:

- Secure context (HTTPS deployment)

  When deploying your application / website for production, make sure to serve it via a secure HTTPS connection. This is required for two reasons
  
  - Access to the camera video stream is only granted in a security context. Most browsers impose this restriction.
  > Some browsers like Chrome may grant the access for `http://127.0.0.1` and `http://localhost` or even for pages opened directly from the local disk (`file:///...`). This can be helpful for temporary development and test.
  
  - Dynamsoft License requires a secure context to work.

- `WebAssembly`, `Blob`, `URL`/`createObjectURL`, `Web Workers`

  The above four features are required for the SDK to work.

- `MediaDevices`/`getUserMedia`

  This API is only required for in-browser video streaming. If a browser does not support this API, the [Single Frame Mode](https://www.dynamsoft.com/barcode-reader/docs/web/programming/javascript/api-reference/BarcodeScanner.html?ver=9.6.0&utm_source=github#singleframemode) will be used automatically. If the API exists but doesn't work correctly, the Single Frame Mode can be used as an alternative way to access the camera.

- `getSettings`

  This API inspects the video input which is a `MediaStreamTrack` object about its constrainable properties.

The following table is a list of supported browsers based on the above requirements:

  Browser Name | Version
  :-: | :-:
  Chrome | v59+<sup>1</sup>
  Firefox | v52+ (v55+ on Android/iOS<sup>1</sup>)
  Edge<sup>2</sup> | v16+
  Safari<sup>3</sup> | v11+

  <sup>1</sup> iOS 14.3+ is required for camera video streaming in Chrome and Firefox or Apps using webviews.

  <sup>2</sup> On Edge, due to strict Same-origin policy, you must host the SDK files on the same domain as your web page.
  
  <sup>3</sup> Safari v11.x already has the required features, but it has many other issues, so we recommend v12+.

Apart from the browsers, the operating systems may impose some limitations of their own that could restrict the use of the SDK. Browser compatibility ultimately depends on whether the browser on that particular operating system supports the features listed above.
